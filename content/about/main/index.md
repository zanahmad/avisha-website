  Welcome to my academic website! My name is Avisha and I am a PhD Candidate at **Johns Hopkins University** in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. My research is at the intersection of machine learning and medicine. I work on optimizing focused ultrasound therapy in neurosurgery with computer vision, acoustic wave modeling, and operator learning. I am affiliated with the [HEPIUS Neurosurgical Innovation Lab](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology-neurosurgery/research/hepius) and the [Neuroengineering Lab](https://neuroengineering.bme.jhu.edu/).

  I received my Bachelor's of Science (Dec 2019) and Master of Engineering (May 2020) degrees at **Cornell University**. During my time there, I was a member of the [Space Systems Design Studio](https://www.spacecraftresearch.com/), with the research focus of spacecraft electrical system development. For my Master's thesis, I delved into algorithms to emulate the mammalian olfactory system with neuromorphic systems. After completing my Masters degree, I spent a year as a computational neuroscience research scientist at **Yale School of Medicine** in the [Blumenfeld Lab](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/blumenfeld/), using signal processing techniques to study the electrical activity of the brain in patients with epilepsy.
